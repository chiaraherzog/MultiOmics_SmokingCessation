## Tyrol Lifestyle Atlas: Smoking cessation study

This repository contains the relevant code to reproduce figures and analyses for the manuscript [``Dynamics of tissue-dependent multi-molecular remodelling during smoking cessation``](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.29.673135) by Herzog, Vavourakis, Theeuwes et al.

The repository is structured as follows:

* figure qmd files: Explanation and code for individual figure panels and analyses.
* helper functions: helper markdown workbooks to compute functions over all variables.
* src/ folder: Functions for computations and visualisation.

Due to data protection, full raw data are not available alongside the repository. Anonymised data for individual assays are available after a one-year embargo and data may be explored using the Tirol Lifestyle App. Linked data are available to bona fide researchers in agreement with the GDPR framework. Details on data structure and access are described here: [doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.30.673115](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.30.673115) and on our [data portal](https://eutops.github.io/lifestyle-atlas/).
